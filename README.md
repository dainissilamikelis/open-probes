# open-probes
open web and api probing initiative

This is a bit of a fun side project for me. I am kinda passionate about probing. In my old workplace I had to setup some pretty complex KPI/SLA cases for probing and I hope this will ease some issues for other people.

# This is build on top of puppeteer and bun
Because why not
1. I have build similar tooling with playwright and I found no real benefit 
2. Try-ing to write my own CDP wrapper

# This project is my passion project and maybe somebody will use it.

# TODO:

1. Re-build engine in type-script and classes
2. Describe API probes
3. Describe WEB probes
